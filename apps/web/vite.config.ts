// `pnpm dev:hot` runs this dev server next to `wrangler dev`, which keeps the
// Worker side hot too. The Worker owns the API, the SSR share/article pages, R2
// attachments and the feeds; proxying those paths keeps the browser on a single
// origin, so Better Auth's cookie and origin checks see the URL that is
// actually in the address bar and no build step sits between an edit and the
// page. Both ports are overridable so a second checkout (or a port-forward from
// another machine) can run its own pair.
// Deliberately not Vite's default 5173: every other Vite project on this
// machine claims that port, so this loop uses its own and `strictPort` turns a
// collision into a loud failure instead of a silent port drift that would also
// break the Worker's origin check.

// Worker sees `Host: localhost:5173` while the browser also sends
// `Origin: http://localhost:5173`, and wrangler's local proxy drops an Origin
// that matches the request host — the Worker then reads a missing Origin and
// rejects every write with "must use FlareMo's origin". Rewriting Host keeps
// the two apart, which is what the origin check wants to see.

// matches its entries as globs, and the trailing slash is what keeps a prefix
// from over-reaching. Without it `/article` would also swallow the SPA's
// `/articles` route, and `/memory` its `/memory` route, serving both from the
// stale build this dev server exists to replace. A parity test in
// src/dev-proxy-parity.test.ts fails if the two lists drift.
