/**
 * Lazy route mounts (issue #138: Workers free-plan CPU budget).
 *
 * The public SSR pages (share/article + sitemap/feed), the MCP surfaces, and
 * the capture/voice (ASR) API used to be statically imported by the worker
 * entry: every isolate paid their module parse cost on every request even
 * when these routes were never hit. They are low-traffic relative to the API
 * hot path, so this module registers small proxy handlers that import the
 * real route tree on first hit and cache it for the isolate's lifetime.
 * Hot-path trees (auth, memos CRUD, memory API) stay static — laziness there
 * would only move the cost around.
 *
 * The proxies forward with the full original path (the sub-app re-registers
 * its own absolute paths), so response semantics, precedence, and status
 * codes are identical to the static-mount layout.
