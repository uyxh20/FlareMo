/**
 * SPA route whitelist for HTTP status semantics (docs/
 * seo-share-pages-best-practices.md P0-5).
 *
 * The worker's `notFound` handler is the SPA fallback: it serves the web app
 * shell for every non-API path. Serving 200 for *unknown* paths turns every
 * typo and dead link into a soft-404 for crawlers. This whitelist mirrors the
 * TanStack Router table in apps/web/src/router-tree.tsx: known frontend
 * routes keep the 200 shell, everything else returns 404 (with the same
 * shell, so the SPA still renders its not-found UI).
 *
 * `apps/worker/src/share-page.test.ts` asserts parity with the web route
 * table so the two cannot drift silently.
