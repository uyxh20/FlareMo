 * user preferences there — which makes otherwise-stateless tests depend on the

 * run:
 *
 * - Composer/capture drafts live in IndexedDB. A leftover draft makes the
 *   composer restore it (Send stays disabled on the text the test just typed)
 *   or /capture open its recovery screen (no record button).
 * - The composer's send target is remembered per space in localStorage
 *   (`flaremo.composer.visibility`). A previously-remembered `private` for the
 *   personal space overrides the team space's `protected` default, so a memo
 *   the test expects in the team timeline is filed — correctly — as personal.
 *
 * Call this before `page.goto`, in any test that depends on a clean draft or
 * on the space-derived send target. Tests that deliberately exercise draft
 * recovery or a remembered preference must NOT call it.
